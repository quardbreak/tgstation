changes: 
  - refactor: "The abductor baton is now a child of the regular stun baton. There shouldn't be a functional difference."
  - tweak: "You need to be an abductor to change baton modes. Seemed like an oversight"
  - spellcheck: "Fixes some typos in the abductor baton's messages"
  - admin: "Both regular stun baton and abductor baton have had a lot of vars exposed pertaining to their functionality so that could come in handy I guess"
