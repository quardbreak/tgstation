  - rscadd: "Disarm intent is now a nonlethal jab that does (5-10) stamina damage. If used on people who are prone, it does (10-15) stamina damage. It also has a chance to completely disarm someone based on the amount of stamina damage they have."
  - balance: "Krav Maga harm stomps/punches now respect armor and have a variance of (5-10) for punches and (5-10+5) for stomps."
